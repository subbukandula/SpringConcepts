Objective (Why)
Migrate monolithic architecture applications into microservices architecture where a bunch of services running in their own separate space and are used to move towards cloud offerings in the API economy

Activites (What)
1) Identify monolithic architecture applications across each Delivery Team.
2) Implement significant new functionality as services.
3) Incrementally extract modules out of the monolith and convert them into services.

Measurement (How)

Benifits (Outcomes)

Easier to Build, Easier to Enhance
Larger applications can remain mostly unaffected by the failure of a single module.
High Quality
Smaller and faster deployments
Scalability

Alignment
